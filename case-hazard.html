                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>I designed and developed a performance-driven safety learning solution that enabled employees to
                        proactively identify, assess, and control workplace hazards. The goal was to move beyond
                        compliance-focused training and build practical decision-making capability that could be applied
                        in dynamic work environments.</p>
                    <p>The program translated complex occupational health and safety legislation into a simplified,
                        actionable framework that frontline employees could use in real time. The solution focused on
                        reducing injuries, improving operational efficiency, and creating a shared language around risk
                        and prevention.</p>

                    <h2>Business Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The organization needed to standardize safety training across multiple provinces while ensuring
                        alignment with varying legislative requirements. Existing training was compliance-focused,
                        knowledge-heavy, and lacked real-world application. As a result:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hazard reporting and risk assessment practices were inconsistent</li>
                        <li>Employees struggled to prioritize risk in complex situations</li>
                        <li>Musculoskeletal injuries such as strains and sprains remained high</li>
                        <li>Managers spent significant time reinforcing safety procedures</li>
                        <li>The organization wanted to shift from reactive incident response to proactive prevention
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The solution needed to support both compliance and capability while driving measurable behavior
                        change.</p>

                    <h2>Strategic Goals</h2>
                    <p>The project was aligned with measurable business and operational outcomes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Achieve 100% compliance with provincial OH&S training requirements</li>
                        <li>Reduce reportable incidents and near-misses by 15% within one year</li>
                        <li>Decrease lost-time injuries related to musculoskeletal risk</li>
                        <li>Standardize hazard identification and assessment across all job sites</li>
                        <li>Increase frontline ownership of safety decisions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Learning Architecture</h2>
                    <p>The course followed a structured performance pathway designed to mirror how employees encounter
                        risk in real work environments:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safety mindset and beliefs</li>
                        <li>Hazard awareness and classification</li>
                        <li>Legal and organizational expectations</li>
                        <li>Hazard identification techniques</li>
                        <li>Risk assessment and prioritization</li>
                        <li>Control strategy selection</li>
                        <li>Real-world application through Field-Level Hazard Assessments</li>
                        <li>Performance-based evaluation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The course began by addressing safety beliefs and attitudes, recognizing that mindset strongly
                        influences hazard recognition and decision-making. This supported a shift from blame-focused
                        safety to systems thinking and proactive risk management.</p>

                    <h2>Instructional Design Approach</h2>

                    <div class="doc-image">
                        <img src="./assets/projects/project1_hazard/images/301dc123-11.png" alt="Scenario-First Design"
                            class="zoomable-image" onclick="openLightbox(this.src)">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Scenario-First Design</h3>
                    <p>Rather than focusing on information delivery, the course emphasized decision-making and
                        real-world application. Learners practiced identifying and evaluating hazards in realistic
                        workplace scenarios such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chemical exposure during furniture finishing</li>
                        <li>Machine and equipment hazards</li>
                        <li>Manual handling and musculoskeletal risk</li>
                        <li>Delivery and field work environments</li>
                        <li>Changing worksite conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This approach built confidence and transfer of learning to the job.</p>

                    <div class="doc-image">
                        <img src="./assets/projects/project1_hazard/images/301dc123-17.png" alt="Progressive Complexity"
                            class="zoomable-image" onclick="openLightbox(this.src)">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Progressive Complexity</h3>
                    <p>The learning experience moved from guided examples to independent application. Early activities
                        focused on awareness and classification, while later modules required learners to independently
                        assess risk and select control strategies.</p>
                    <p>This scaffolded design improved retention and reduced cognitive overload.</p>

                    <div class="doc-image">
                        <img src="./assets/projects/project1_hazard/images/301dc123-18.png" alt="Interactive Discovery"
                            class="zoomable-image" onclick="openLightbox(this.src)">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Interactive Discovery</h3>
                    <p>The course incorporated interactive exploration to increase engagement and reflection:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flip-card activities for hazard recognition</li>
                        <li>Interactive tabs for legislation and control strategies</li>
                        <li>Drag-and-drop classification</li>
                        <li>Guided risk ranking</li>
                        <li>Embedded knowledge checks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These interactions promoted active learning rather than passive consumption.</p>

                    <div class="doc-image">
                        <img src="./assets/projects/project1_hazard/images/301dc123-19.png"
                            alt="Simulation & Decision Practice" class="zoomable-image"
                            onclick="openLightbox(this.src)">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Simulation & Decision Practice</h3>
                    <p>One of the most critical design elements was an interactive risk assessment experience. Learners
                        evaluated hazards by assigning values for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Probability of occurrence</li>
                        <li>Severity of consequences</li>
                        <li>Frequency of exposure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They then observed how these factors influenced overall risk priority. This transformed a
                        theoretical risk matrix into a practical decision tool that aligned directly with real workplace
                        assessments.</p>
                    <p>The simulation reduced subjectivity in decision-making and reinforced consistent risk evaluation
                        across job sites.</p>

                    <div class="doc-image">
                        <img src="./assets/projects/project1_hazard/images/301dc123-22.png"
                            alt="Behavioral & Cultural Design" class="zoomable-image" onclick="openLightbox(this.src)">
                    </div>
                    <h3>Behavioral & Cultural Design</h3>
                    <p>The course emphasized that incident prevention is influenced by both individual behavior and
                        organizational systems. By addressing underlying beliefs, the program supported a culture shift
                        from reactive safety and blame toward proactive risk awareness and shared responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Learners explored how personal experience, perception of risk, and workplace culture influence
                        decision-making. This helped build stronger psychological ownership of safety.</p>

                    <h3>Performance Transfer & Real-World Application</h3>
                    <p>A key focus was ensuring that learning transferred beyond course completion. The program
                        introduced both:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formal hazard assessment processes</li>
                        <li>Field-Level Hazard Assessments (FLHAs)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Learners practiced identifying new and changing hazards in dynamic work environments. This
                        supported ongoing safety awareness and adaptability in field and delivery contexts.</p>
                    <p>The FLHA framework provided employees with a structured, repeatable decision process that could
                        be used daily.</p>

                    <h3>Assessment Strategy</h3>
                    <p>The assessment approach focused on performance rather than memorization. Instead of traditional
                        quizzes alone, learners were required to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify hazards in real-world scenarios</li>
                        <li>Prioritize risks based on severity and exposure</li>
                        <li>Select appropriate control strategies</li>
                        <li>Apply the hierarchy of controls</li>
                        <li>Demonstrate decision-making capability</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This aligned evaluation with actual job tasks.</p>

                    <h3>Tools & Technology</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Articulate Storyline</li>
                        <li>Scenario-based learning design</li>
                        <li>Interactive simulations</li>
                        <li>Agile development methodology</li>
                        <li>Mobile-friendly and accessible design</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Results & Business Impact</h2>
                    <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Post-course assessment scores averaged 94%, significantly exceeding
                        the 80% pass threshold.</p>
                    <p><strong>Behavior Change:</strong> Field-Level Hazard Assessments increased by 40% in the first
                        quarter, demonstrating strong transfer of learning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Standardization reduced coaching and rework, saving
                        managers approximately 10 hours per month.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> The program created a shared framework and language for
                        discussing safety and risk, improving collaboration between frontline teams and leadership.</p>

                    <h2>Stakeholder Feedback</h2>
                    <p><em>“This course has given us a common language and framework for discussing safety. We’re now
                            having more proactive conversations about risk instead of reactive ones about
                            blame.”</em><br>— Safety Department Lead</p>

                    <h2>Reflection & Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>This project reinforced my belief that effective safety learning must move beyond compliance and
                        focus on real-world decision-making. When learners repeatedly practice applying frameworks in
                        realistic environments, measurable behavior change becomes possible.</p>
                    <p>Future enhancements could include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adaptive learning pathways based on role</li>
                        <li>AI-driven safety simulations</li>
                        <li>Integration with real incident data</li>
                        <li>Predictive risk analytics</li>
                    </ul>
